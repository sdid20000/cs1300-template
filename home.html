    Taking a look at Home Oven UI
  </h1>
  <p class="text">Here I'll be taking a look at the user-interface of a home oven. Here you will find a collection of
    user experiences, interviews, personas,
    and a storyboard regarding the use of a home oven.
  </p>
  <h2 class="header">The Interface</h2>
  <img id="OvenUI" src="./images/OvenInterface.png">
  <p class="text">The main point of this interface is to present all of the different options available to a cook while
    still being intuitive and easy to understand.
    With the main focus being on the temperature and time, even a cook with no need for the extra features can easily
    navigate the UI.
  </p>
  <h2 class="header">Key Observations</h2>
  <p class="text">Here are some key observations I made from observing three different individuals using this interface:
  </p>
  <ul class="text">
    <li>One user did not wait for the oven to finish preheating before putting food in.</li>
    <li>Mysteriously, none of the users used the built-in timer on the oven.</li>
    <li>Users returned after a period of time, visually checking to see if the food was done. If satisfied, they would
      take the food out and turn the oven off</li>
  </ul>



  <h2 class="header">Interviews</h2>
  <p class="text"> Here is a summary of the responses from three different individuals when asked about the oven
    interface:
  </p>
  <div id="interview-list">
    <ol class="text">
      <hr class="divider">
      <li>Let’s say you were heating up some frozen food in the oven. Could you walk me through the steps you’d take in
        detail? </li>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
      <hr class="divider">
      <li>What features of the oven do you use? Do you use some more frequently than others?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Most frequently, users used the " Bake" function more than other features. </li>
        <li>Users would use other features under special ocassions. One user uses the proof feature when baking bread.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr class="divider">
      <li>When would you use the oven vs other heating methods?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Users would use the oven over other heating methods when cooking large meals and heating frozen foods.</li>
        <li>When not cooking those kinds of meals, the stovetop or microwave were preferable.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr class="divider">
      <li>When cooking, do you like setting specific temperaturs and times? Or do you prefer working with a more
        relative
        "higher" or "longer"?</li>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
      <hr class="divider">
      <li>Do you usually set a timer when cooking? Do you use the oven timer or an external timer? If you do not use the
        oven timer, why not?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>All users reported not using the built-in timer when cooking, and used an external timer. They said that
          using the oven timer was cumbersome and difficult to set up, while external timers were easy and portable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr class="divider">
    </ol>
