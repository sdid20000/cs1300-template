    Taking a look at Home Oven UI
  </h1>
  <p class="text">Here I'll be taking a look at the user-interface of a home oven. Here you will find a collection of
    user experiences, interviews, personas,
    and a storyboard regarding the use of a home oven.
  </p>
  <h2 class="header">The Interface</h2>
  <img id="OvenUI" src="./images/OvenInterface.png">
  <p class="text">The main point of this interface is to present all of the different options available to a cook while
    still being intuitive and easy to understand.
    With the main focus being on the temperature and time, even a cook with no need for the extra features can easily
    navigate the UI.
  </p>
  <h2 class="header">Key Observations</h2>
  <p class="text">Here are some key observations I made from observing three different individuals using this interface:
  </p>
  <ul class="text">
    <li>Here is an observation</li>
    <li>Here is another observation</li>
    <li>Here is a final observation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="header">Interviews</h2>
  <p class="text"> Here is a summary of the responses from three different individuals when asked about the oven
    interface:
  </p>
  <ol class="text">
    <li>Let’s say you were heating up some frozen food in the oven. Could you walk me through the steps you’d take in
      detail? </li>
    <li>What features of the oven do you use? Do you use some more frequently than others?</li>
    <li>When would you use the oven vs other heating methods?</li>
    <li>Do you feel the current UI is too cluterred?</li>
    <li>Do you feel the current UI is easy to use?</li>
    <li>When cooking, do you like setting specific temperaturs and times? Or do you prefer working with a more relative
      "higher" or "longer"</li>
    <li>Do you usually set a timer when cooking? Do you use the oven timer or an external timer?</li>
  </ol>
